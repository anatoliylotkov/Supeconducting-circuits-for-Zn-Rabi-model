@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="Here we use a nonstandard notation: ket-states with subscript $\protect \hat  a$ or $\protect \hat  b$ to differentiate between different bases for the boson modes."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="We use brackets to denote the Fourier-transformed operators' dependence on the wavevector. On the other hand, for real space operators we use subscripts for their coordinate dependence as usual."}
